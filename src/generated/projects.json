Pilviväylä aimed to build a trusted and easy-to-use service that helps schools acquire cloud-computing solutions to support their educational efforts. Core values in Pilviväylä were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>openness and transparency</li>\n<li>open data and open source</li>\n<li>open APIs</li>\n<li>community-driven working methods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I worked with a team during three and a half months to successfully deliver this project. The platform was not continued, but its authentication module turned out to be the foundation for the Ministry&#39;s later official system, which is currently used in all Finnish schools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/projects/bazaar.jpg\" alt=\"Bazaar\"></p>\n<p>Click <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/educloudalliance\">here</a> to explore the Bazaar project overview.</p>\n",
