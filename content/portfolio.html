                                <b>Abstract:</b> Tangible technologies provide interactive links between the physical
                                and digital worlds. Tangible interaction merges the benefits of physical and virtual
                                manipulatives. To explore the potentials of tangible technologies for learning linear
                                equations, a tangible manipulative was designed and developed. The proposed manipulative
                                was implemented and evaluated using mixed methods (i.e., classroom interventions,
                                paper-based tests, thinking aloud sessions, questionnaires, and interviews) in real
                                classroom settings. Six teachers, 24 primary school students, and 65 lower secondary
                                school students participated in the research. The quantitative and qualitative analysis
                                revealed that the tangible manipulative supported student learning at various levels and
                                had a positive impact on their learning achievement. Moreover, its overall usability was
                                also accepted. Some minor improvements for pedagogy and usability could be implemented.
                                These findings indicate that the proposed manipulative is likely to be beneficial to
                                linear equation learning in pre-primary to lower secondary schools and usable in
                                mathematics classrooms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

                                <b>Abstract:</b> The focus of this work is on the problem of team recommendations, in
                                which teams have multidisciplinary requirements and team members’ selection is based on
                                the match of their skills and the requirements. When assembling multiple teams there is
                                also a challenge of allocating the best members in a fair way between the teams. We
                                formally define the problem and propose a brute force and a faster heuristic method as
                                solutions to create team recommendations to multidisciplinary projects. Furthermore, to
                                increase the fairness between the recommended teams, the K-rounds and Pairs-rounds
                                methods are proposed as variations of the heuristic approach. Several different test
                                scenarios are executed to analyze and compare the effectiveness of these methods.

                                <b>Abstract:</b> With the ever increasing amount of data in the world, it becomes
                                harder to find useful and desired information. Recommender systems, which offer a
                                way to analyze that data and suggest relevant information, are already common
                                nowadays and a important part of several systems and services. While recommender
                                systems are often used for suggesting items for users, there are not many studies
                                about using them for problems such as team formation. This thesis focus on exploring
                                a variation of that problem, in which teams have multidisciplinary requirements and
                                members' selection is based on the match of their skills and the requirements. In
                                addition, when assembling multiple teams there is a challenge of allocating the best
                                members in a fair way between the teams.

                                With the studied concepts from the literature, this thesis suggests a brute force
                                and a faster heuristic method as solutions to create team recommendations to
                                multidisciplinary projects. Furthermore, to increase the fairness between the
                                recommended teams, the K-rounds and Pairs-rounds methods are proposed as variations
                                of the heuristic approach.
                                <br>
                                Several different test scenarios are executed to analyze and compare the efficiency
                                and efficacy of these methods, and it is found that the heuristic-based methods are
                                able to provide the same levels of quality with immensely greater performance than
                                the brute force approach. The K-rounds method is able to generate substantially more
                                fair team recommendations, while keeping the same levels of quality and performance
                                as other methods. The Pairs-rounds method presents slightly better recommendations
                                quality-wise than the K-rounds method, but its recommendations are less fair to a
                                small degree. The proposed methods perform well enough for use in real scenarios.

                                <b>Abstract:</b> Innovations being achieved with interactive devices (screens,
                                sensors etc.) allow the development of new forms of interaction for many
                                applications. Videogames played with these devices are completely changing how we
                                use them and taking advantage of intuitive interfaces. Based on that, we ask “What
                                aspects of playability are affected using different input devices for a certain
                                gaming task and how is gaming performance affected?”. Our contribution is to present
                                a practical evaluation of four different input devices (Mouse, Gamepad, Kinect and
                                Touchscreen) used to interact with the same game, Fruit Ninja, with our data
                                analysis indicating that changing input device brings significant differences in
                                certain aspects of player experience for this game, such as sensation, challenge and
                                control, while for others there was very little difference since this particular
                                game rarely provides intense experiences for those aspects.
