                            <b>Abstract:</b> With the ever increasing amount of data in the world, it becomes
                            harder to find useful and desired information. Recommender systems, which offer a
                            way to analyze that data and suggest relevant information, are already common
                            nowadays and a important part of several systems and services. While recommender
                            systems are often used for suggesting items for users, there are not many studies
                            about using them for problems such as team formation. This thesis focus on exploring
                            a variation of that problem, in which teams have multidisciplinary requirements and
                            members' selection is based on the match of their skills and the requirements. In
                            addition, when assembling multiple teams there is a challenge of allocating the best
                            members in a fair way between the teams.
                            <br>
                            With the studied concepts from the literature, this thesis suggests a brute force
                            and a faster heuristic method as solutions to create team recommendations to
                            multidisciplinary projects. Furthermore, to increase the fairness between the
                            recommended teams, the K-rounds and Pairs-rounds methods are proposed as variations
                            of the heuristic approach.
                            <br>
                            Several different test scenarios are executed to analyze and compare the efficiency
                            and efficacy of these methods, and it is found that the heuristic-based methods are
                            able to provide the same levels of quality with immensely greater performance than
                            the brute force approach. The K-rounds method is able to generate substantially more
                            fair team recommendations, while keeping the same levels of quality and performance
                            as other methods. The Pairs-rounds method presents slightly better recommendations
                            quality-wise than the K-rounds method, but its recommendations are less fair to a
                            small degree. The proposed methods perform well enough for use in real scenarios.

                            <b>Abstract:</b> Innovations being achieved with interactive devices (screens,
                            sensors etc.) allow the development of new forms of interaction for many
                            applications. Videogames played with these devices are completely changing how we
                            use them and taking advantage of intuitive interfaces. Based on that, we ask “What
                            aspects of playability are affected using different input devices for a certain
                            gaming task and how is gaming performance affected?”. Our contribution is to present
                            a practical evaluation of four different input devices (Mouse, Gamepad, Kinect and
                            Touchscreen) used to interact with the same game, Fruit Ninja, with our data
                            analysis indicating that changing input device brings significant differences in
                            certain aspects of player experience for this game, such as sensation, challenge and
                            control, while for others there was very little difference since this particular
                            game rarely provides intense experiences for those aspects.
