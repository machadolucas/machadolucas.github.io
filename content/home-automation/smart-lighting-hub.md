The Smart Lighting Hub bridges Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and Thread networks so households can choreograph lighting scenes without worrying about vendor lock-in.

### Highlights

- Normalizes device telemetry into a single schema, then streams it into Home Assistant for automations.
- Ships with a TypeScript SDK so makers can script "if this then that" routines with plain functions.
- Includes an adaptive lighting engine that maps circadian-friendly color temperatures throughout the day.

### My role

Designed the device discovery pipeline, built the SDK, and tuned the adaptive lighting algorithm for natural light transitions.
