RetroStash is a personal archive platform designed for indie storytellers who need to curate, annotate, and share multimedia collections without losing ownership of their work.

### Highlights

- Built with **React 19** and the **React95** design system to keep everything nostalgic yet modern.
- Synchronizes large media libraries using **Cloudflare R2** with transparent retry logic for unreliable networks.
- Ships with an offline-first caching layer that allows curators to keep browsing and editing even without connectivity.

### My role

I designed the end-to-end architecture, implemented the syncing engine, and shaped the authoring UX so that the platform feels approachable to non-technical creators.
