[Bazaar](https://github.com/educloudalliance "Click to access Bazaar") was part of the Pilviväylä project, ran by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture. Pilviväylä aimed to build a trusted and easy-to-use service that helps schools acquire cloud-computing solutions to support their educational efforts. Core values in Pilviväylä were:

* openness and transparency
* open data and open source
* open APIs
* community-driven working methods

I worked with a team during three and a half months to successfully deliver this project. The platform was not continued, but its authentication module turned out to be the foundation for the Ministry's later official system, which is currently used in all Finnish schools.
