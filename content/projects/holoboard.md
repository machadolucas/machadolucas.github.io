HoloBoard is a multiplayer whiteboard that keeps remote teams ideating in sync, even on constrained networks.

### Highlights

- Uses **CRDTs** to ensure conflict-free drawing, even when multiple participants edit the same shapes simultaneously.
- Embeds lightweight **WebRTC** voice rooms so participants can jump into audio without leaving the session.
- Hooks into service webhooks to capture moments of insight automatically into Jira or Linear.

### My role

Led the architecture for real-time data flows, built the media services, and created the plug-in system so third parties can extend the canvas experience.
