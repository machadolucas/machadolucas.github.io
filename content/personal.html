                    <p>Photos are much more than images. Each one of them have a context, a meaning, a motivation, a
                        value, and a soul... They can portrait the reality in its crudest form, distort it, and create
                        unique feelings and sensations.</p>

                                With 17 years old, I began to study Information Systems at <a
                                    href="http://www5.usp.br/en/" target="_blank">University of

                            <p>In the university, I suggested and led the &quot;1º Dia do Descarte Legal&quot; (First
                                Day of Nice Disposal), which was an event to raise awareness about the correct disposal
                                of electronic waste and collect it from the university community. It was very
                                successful.</p>
                            <p>
                                In June I started working as a programmer at <a

                                where I was for more than 3 years.

                            <p>Within an university course, I suggested changes in the EACH/USP website, turning the
